# Unit Tests vs End-to-End Tests

## Types of Tests

1. Unit Tests
2. Integration Tests
3. E2E Tests (UI testing)
4. Manual Tests


### Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on individual units of code in the program (a single class, module, object or method)
- Elements are tested in isolation; the program is not tested well.
- The specs are easy to write and run fast.


### End-to-end (E2E) or acceptance 

tests focus on a feature and its interaction with the entire system.
- Elements are tested together, the complete program is tested with a good deal of confidence.
- The specs are hard to write, brittle and run slow.
